# TSMixer Multivariate Time Series Forecasting

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06053.pdf

This model used two MLP layers, one for time and one for features, which are combined using fully connected layers to create forecasts for all features.

The paper tested this model on electricity, traffic, weather as well as retail data. It outperformed all multivariate models, and was as good as univariate models on univariate data.

The model is implemented in PyTorch, and is available in the `tsmixer` package.

The input to the model are matrices where the rows are time steps and the columns are features. There is an extended version of the model where known upcoming events can be included in the forecast.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip

```bash
pip install -e .
```

# Usage
```python
print("hello world")

```

### Code Quality ðŸ§¹

We provide two handy commands inside the `Makefile`, namely:

- `make style` to format the code
- `make check_code_quality` to check code quality (PEP8 basically)
- `black .`
- `ruff . --fix`
- 'flake8 .' which includes torchfix

### Tests ðŸ§ª

[`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) is used to run our tests.

### Publish on PyPi ðŸš€

**Important**: Before publishing, edit `__version__` in [src/__init__](/src/__init__.py) to match the wanted new version.

```
poetry build
poetry publish
```

### CI/CD ðŸ¤–

We use [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically run tests and check code quality when a new PR is done on `main`.

On any pull request, we will check the code quality and tests.

When a new release is created, we will try to push the new code to PyPi. We use [`twine`](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to make our life easier. 

The **correct steps** to create a new realease are the following:
- edit `__version__` in [src/__init__](/src/__init__.py) to match the wanted new version.
- create a new [`tag`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag) with the release name, e.g. `git tag v0.0.1 && git push origin v0.0.1` or from the GitHub UI.
- create a new release from GitHub UI

The CI will run when you create the new release.
